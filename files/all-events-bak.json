This is a unique and creative custom designed sensory performance. Not for the faint of heart. Eros Tangeré is a one on one, sensual adult event.

Sovereign Breath creates an altered state in which many experiences are possible facilitated by your higher self. Bring what you most want to release, shift, gain insight about, step into, affirm and create. Be ready for change. This form of breathwork grows out of rebirthing and is a more feminine, gentle and allowing practice than other more aggressive and cathartic forms.

    "description": "The legendary Orgasmatron first came to the playa in 2002, and it provided exceptional physical pleasure to thousands of women in an environment that was safe, comfortable, sensual and private. Six years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss. Lines are shortest early in the week, and early in the day.",

    "description": "\"Unfucking Sexuality is about decoupling the sex-craving instincts from the desire to connect intimately. Infinite openness awaits your surrender.\n\nWhen we can separate our desire for sex from our desire to connect intimately, a canvas of possibility emerges in the space between two hearts where we can truly explore intimacy as art.  \n\nHuman beings need touch, comfort, safety, love, and intimacy in their lives to feel whole, welcome, complete, and content. Attaining the combination of this cocktail of bliss often is only experienced through a sexual relationship of some kind, and rarely are all of these needs met simultaneously, or by the same person. \n\nOften, along the path to deepening a relationship or flirtatious connection, one partner or the other begins to dabble with sexual energy through flirting, playful touch, sexy talk, innuendo, or other strategies in an effort to shift the situation into an opening for sexual connection and orgasmic release. \n\nSexual energy is incredibly powerful, playful, blissful, and transformative, yet it can also be overwhelmingly tricky and even deceitful to one's self and others if not stewarded with care. \n\nThis workshop explores the fine lines between sexuality and intimacy, between loving touch and sexual touch, and between desire to be with someone intimately and the desire to fuck. \n\nThrough practicing clear and open communication, bringing awareness to the energy in our bodies and intention in our hearts, and by relaxing into the openness of the moment and surrendering any agenda for where it may be leading, the relational space can be transformed into a mysteriously infinite void of possibilities where literally anything can happen. \n\nCountless women have confided in me that they are frustrated beyond measure by their partner's (or men in general's) inability to be with them in a way that makes them feel safe, free to express their fullness, and feel loved, cherished, and comfortable in their bodies.",

    "description": "French Maids have become indispensable to the spiritual progress of Black Rock City, no more so than in 2017 with the unprecedented proliferation of altars, most of which have ceased to function properly. Reports have come in that these altars are of no spiritual benefit whatsoever. In fact, the consensus among the BMOrg is that the spiritual growth of Burning Man has somehow been stunted. It’s been scientifically proven that the spiritual efficacy of altars is greatly diminished by even trivial amounts of dust. Fortunately, the French Maid Brigade, summoned to task by the BMOrg, is on hand to correct this situation. No matter how much dust your radical ritual kicks up, French Maids will be there to ensure a spiritual journey unencumbered by dust.\n\nRendezvous with us! You too can be one of the sexiest clean freaks on the playa—please bring: feather dusters, rags, dustbusters, service carts, vacuums, white gloves, latex gloves, enema kits, lube, and any other useful cleaning equipment. Join us in uniform with your surly attitude and worst possible French accent.\n\nOn Thursday at 2:00 pm we meet at 3 O’Clock and Esplanade then dust our way through every filthy, nasty camp on our march toward that dust bucket known as Center Camp Café, liberate them from their dusty oppression, and celebrate our triumph!",

    "description": "\"High energy beats, massage, up-regulating breathwork, Taoist big draws, awakening energy and intense mind altering sober psychedelic experience.\n--\n\nOften in moments of intense experiences we find answers to solutions we could not access. Benjamin facilitates an experience through high energy beats, partner based massage, up-regulating breathwork, Taoist big draws, and awakening energy with the potential to unlock intense mind altering sober psychedelic experiences. Are you curious?\n\nThe workshop explores embodiment using one-directional partnered massage. Each set of paired individuals will explore what it means to be in their bodies and fully present while receiving one-directional touch from their chosen giver. If an individual can master blocks in their own body, search for releases, discover new methods, or find hidden gems from being present, it creates a foundation of opportunities that can be unleashed. Some benefits to receiving one-directional touch can be:\n• Self awareness\n• Communication skills\n• Desires & goals\n• Coping with insecurities\n• Decision making\n• Shifting mental states\n• Letting go (aka release)\n• Moving forward\n• Opening doors\n\nHow to prepare:\nThis workshop is partner based or can be experienced solo. A crucial consent, boundaries, and communication section will be covered at the beginning. Individuals will have an opportunity to choose a partner. Please be open to same gender pairings. Triad groups are also encouraged, however one person will not be able to receive due to time constraints. This work can include genital or anal touch, but is not required or expected. You can be fully clothed or naked as when you were born. We mention this so you can be comfortable with others choices in a shared space and define your own boundaries.",

The alignment itself takes center stage just a few minutes before and after midnight.

This pegging workshop is open to everyone but tailored to female-identifying humans—pegging princesses in training! Regardless of the anatomy with which you were born, sticking things in your ass feels good. In fact, prostate stimulation can produce orgasms up to 10 times stronger and/or more intense than an average genital-stimulation-only orgasm (lucky prostate owners). Pegging is about pleasure plain and simple and humans are enjoying ass play and pegging without shame or stigma now more than ever. Ass play is for everyone! I’ve been ass fucking and blogging my way to pegging princess empowerment for 12 years and want to share my love of all things penetration with you. I LOVE pegging. It makes me feel powerful, sexy, and feminine. I love the view, I love the adoration I get in return, and I love being a part of heightened levels of sexual pleasure for my partner. Pegging need not be about dominating, humiliating, or degrading your partner.  Join me as we leave our fears behind, bring pegging out of the shadows and into the lighter side of kink, and explore safe pegging 101 and beginner equipment. The workshop includes an interactive demonstration, question and answer, and a few surprises. Now let’s rock out with our girl cocks out!",

    "description": "Jason Gore runs an executive coaching firm for fast-growing startups.  They firm primarily work with highly-innovative companies that will reshape a given industry or domain.  \n\nMany of their clients are young engineers who suddenly found themselves leading large teams.  They needed to learn what “good leadership” was, identify their blind spots, practice new communication skills, and improve their ability to lead.  After conducting 100s of leadership assessments, the firm has been able to scientifically define what good leadership is when it comes to building teams and innovating in the startup environment.\n\nIn this interactive presentation, Jason, the firm's cofounder, will share some of their discoveries, how leadership can be defined, and most-importantly, how what we learn by co-creating in community turns out to be the exact same skills that leaders are learning at startups.  \n\nFestivals like Burning Man are more than just a good time—they are a training ground for leaders, community, and innovation. There’s a reason that many startup leaders go to Burning Man and other festivals. \n\nTogether, we’ll look at what we have already learned about leadership though our community experiences and how to apply those skills to leadership in the default world.  Everyone in the audience will also receive a self-assessment (printed or online) to identify areas that they could improve.",

Attend office hours or just drop on by and ring the bell for service!  And those wanting to join team RAD Services are invited to contact us!  \n\nWe at RAD Services aren't going to own/produce/design your ritual. We don't loan/gift equipment to you. What we do is show up in person, with our stuff, and augment/decorate your ritual with visual pizzazz and auditory depth!\n\nHere is a list of some of the services that we provide (some best in low light venues):\n\n- LED image painting: Image poi, with is a programmable sticks of LEDs, can trace out any image when moved or spun, e.g., fire, lightening, patterns, words, pictures, etc.  Also, these LED props can produce interesting visual affects even when not moved quickly, e.g., flames, fuses, torches, pulsating lights, etc., etc.\n\n- Sound: We at RAD are able to provide a wide range of mobile audio support, e.g., music for a parade/procession or clear dialog for weddings or other ceremonies. Our electric trike moves the audio with your moving ritual/parade.\n\n- Fire: Torches, staff, fire ropes, orbs, poi spinning, etc.\n\n- Video: Front or back lit video projection can help add a new layer of interest to your ritual. You provide the projection surface (e.g., EasyUp side wall) and we bring the equipment.\n\n- Blinky: Many props to decorate any low light ritual, including: LED poi (dynamic color changes), LED staff (two image poi brought together), LED image poi (see above), fiber optic whips (think swarm of fire flies).\n\n- Music: Airy Native American flute background music and parade drum cadence music services are available.\n\nSo, you come up with the ritual and we at RAD help make it even more awesome.

This is a safe, fun way to meet new people who are also participating in Open Relating and to gain some practical tools for your relationship or future relationship(s)!\n\nTo chose to live and relate in an open or polyamorous way requires a community of like-minded souls. Without community we do not have the necessary support we need as couples and individuals to love as big as our hearts desire.\n\nWhy we each consciously choose to live in alternative ways then the ones that were passed down to us from earlier generations is very personal. Some do it to increase the variety of sexual partners and others do it as a spiritual path to embrace the light and shadow of opening up.\n\nThere are many ways to make it work. Some people have stated agreements meanwhile others rely on embodied principles and some are just totally radical. Regardless of your personal preference, most of us were not raised with role models for this alternative way of relating. So we must come together to role model and mirror one another.\n\nAs the definition and practice of relating is expanding beyond what we were taught unconsciously by our parents we want to invite you to join the conversation. How do you navigate these waters? What have you found that works? Come just to listen and observe or come to participate and add your own thoughts, questions and perspectives into the conversation.\n\nWe invite you to share what is most alive in your heart and come join the conversation of open relationships where we aim to come together to create a Culture of Conscious Relating.",

Taking motivation from this year's Burning Man theme, we thought we would tap into a the Radical Ritual and play with a fun concept...\n\nStarting the day with spirituality, we end the day with incredible music. After leaving the first new moon of spring behind, we finalised our program and created a daytime/nighttime 12 hours program of our dreams.\n\n12:00 - 13:00\nWe start the day with our community college. We are constantly attracting new roads to explore. We hear friends talk about life changing experiences. We read articles on different ways of life. It leads to so many questions. What is ayahuasca? Should I do Vipassana? Why does Sting love tantric sex? Our community college invites inspirational speakers to provide information on interesting topics. Join this talk, be inspired or just listen to the many wonders of the world.\n\n13:00 - 14:00\nAs we gather in the desert for more than a week, we take the opportunity of this event to ground you, in the desert. Take a moment to step away from the outside world and connect with your home. A beautiful guided meditation accompanied by a celestial communication followed by a cleanse. Not only will this spiritual ceremony set the energy for the rest of our day, it will offer you so much light the rest of the week.\n\n14:00 - 00:00\nAs we slowly move from our spiritual self into our spiritual animal, we've created a musical program to get those who are passing by stop and dance. Our camp members are completely transformed into wild performers, face painters, tantric masseuses and more.",

Stools, tables and counters are spread out over a platform.  Each stool has a different color and colored spots are on the bar, the floor, the monkey bars overhead and even the swings on the edge.  Some stools even have numbers or symbols.  The bartender picks from a stack of overly large cards to find out what happens next (or they can just make up a new rule!).  For example, It could be that all people sitting on yellow seats have to go to a blue seat, but they can’t touch the ground, hot lava!  They must climb over and around people, keeping hold of their drinks, of course!  They may have to get a partner and find seats that add up to a certain number.  They may need to have a hand on a certain color and the butts on a different color.  They may have to sit on the bar, hang from the monkey bar, sit on the monkey bar, one foot on a swing, one hand on...the bartender themselves!  There are so many versions and iterations of different rules that the fun is endless.   The patrons will be encouraged, through the cards, to interact with each other as well as those in the street.  There are no points and not even a goal of the game other than to share in the fun and make some new friends!\nBartenders wear matching twister-themed outfits and carry super soaker water guns filled with a tasty cocktail.

Now, returning from Standing Rock to Black Rock, we come together with global synchronised prayer platform Unify, and cultural force Mayan Warrior, to continue the prayer that started at Standing Rock.\n\nFor generations, Native American culture has held that the drum is the heartbeat of Mother Earth, and the water, her veins.  Indigenous tribes use drums in various ways to interact with a higher power, known to many as The Great Spirit.  Drums are the channel we use to connect to our spirit, to each other, and to the spirit of Earth. Water is sacred.  MNI WICONI!\n\nThe historic, global gathering of hundreds of tribes at Standing Rock standing together for the first time for our water has been prophesied for these times.  Now, we gather under the Medicine Wheel of all nations to carry this prayer forward.  It has been said that peace will not come to our Earth until the circle of humanity is complete; until all four colours sit in circle under the Medicine Wheel and share their teachings. \n\nCome and experience our unification as a human family as we dance together under the Medicine Wheel to the beat of the drum, playing out to all of Black Rock City on the Playa's best sound-system.  Pray with us on the Playa or engage with us online as we stream our prayer out to over 15 million people using Unify's platform. Join us.  Together, we pray for good health and better understanding.  Together, we pray for deep listening.  Together, we pray for unity, for peace, and for love. \n\nThis is a historic moment you won't want to miss.\n\nThis is our Radical Ritual.",

Informational/experiential workshop for couples with at least one female!\n\nInspired by Naomi Wolf's Vagina (her book, not the real thing). So if no-one's told you, or you haven't noticed yet, men and women are different! Just how different, particularly in sexual response, is only recently being discovered by western science. The famous study of sexuality in the swinging sixties by Masters and Johnson was largely about male sexuality and in a stunning failure of the scientific method they kinda assumed women were pretty much the same......\"\"two arms, two legs, a head, yeah, I think they're pretty much going to react the same way....\"\" without actually finding out until 50/60 years later!\n\nBut there are and have been more enlightened cultures than ours on these matters. It turns out that some eastern cultures had got a very detailed handle on female sexuality thousands of years ago. Ancient tantric teachings turn out to be not a set of arcane practises based on spiritual mumbo jumbo but precise systems of activating the fullness of the feminine sexual response, now being verified by the latest research in neuroscience in the west.\n\nWolf calls this range of specific stimulations the Goddess Array, and I shall attempt to describe the steps that every woman needs that men don't need and create a container for you to experience the majority of them in one of Naked Heart's carpeted domes. \n\nPlease bring nesting materials and a secret gift for your goddess.",

Many are sensitive enough to feel it and are called to explore and encourage it, even at the risk of their masculine egos and roles in society.  Come discuss in an open forum what this journey means to you, how we can work in harmony with it, balance it with our more masculine traits, and get on with the work of healing the damage of patriarchy within and without. All genders and orientations welcome.",

    "description": "Partnered breathing meditation focused on generating intimacy, emotional openness, and physical bonding in a safe, guided, non-sexual way.\n\n\"Belly2Belly partnered breathing meditation is a deceptively simple process that rests on multiple dimensions of neurobiology, pranayama, focused sensory awareness, tantric ritual, intimate communion, witness consciousness, sound entrainment, sequenced relaxation, psychological regression, shadow work, neurolinguistic programming, wizardry and primate zoology.\n\nThe exercises are designed to dissolve the Western experience of separate self into rhythmic waves of sensation and feeling that are shared with a partner in real time.\n\nWhat results is a profoundly felt sense of peace and connection, a natural biochemical high that neuro-mirrors intimate love, meditative samadhi and mystical oneness.\n\nThe Belly2Belly practices were developed by David Cates in his healing work with sexual trauma. The results were so  potent that David adapted many of the exercises to share in groups.\n\nIn groups, we focus on generating intimacy, emotional openness, and physical bonding in a safe, slow, guided non-sexual way. We reawaken our primal need for human connection, animal to animal, body to body, heart to heart, without the stress or uncertainty of sex. By trusting our bodies and each other, we reclaim our original innocence... and remember we are safe.\"",

Many of us have engaged in sensual touch with a lover or tickling at a young age, but are you aware of how well the two can work together to make an amazing sensory experience with someone? Whether it is tickling to tears, to moans of delight, or simply squirming Domme Kelli Lynn Sage and Bagelfather are well versed in this and will be leading this class in sensual touch and the art of tickling with a partner. We have learned the ropes over the years and want to pass our wisdom on to you. We will instruct you, with the help of audience volunteers, in the art of tickling and sensual touch. \n\nWe will also cover consent, basic bondage, negotiation, safe words, having a positive relationship with kink, as well as touching. This event is for those 18 years old and over (please bring your ID if you look young). People of all gender identities are welcome to attend. It is best if you can come with a partner so you can practice some of what you learn, if you come alone we cannot guarantee to partner you up with someone. We recommend bringing a towel or something similar to lay on the ground to sit on. In addition we ask that you be respectful of all participants and remind you to ask before touching someone that you have not made arrangements before hand.\n\nIf you wish to volunteer ahead of time email Bagelfather@gmail.com, also feel free to let us know before we start if you are interested in demonstrating.",

My belief is that investigating these principals will give us the tools to create more dances in the “SWEET SPOT”, where your brain gets to shut off and you body moves with grace.\nIf you have never dance before, Gina will take you though exercises that will give you the confidence to move with another person. \nAnd, if you are an accomplished dancer from any genre consider this your cross training. Gina will be exposing  you to concepts that will take your dance to the next level. Specifically giving you some tools to enable you to have connection and conversation with all levels of dancers. \nCome play with us!",

It’s like a crepe, only tastier and more transportable, something quintessential when it comes to all the lightning-quick decisions you have to make on the playa.  A blintz is one standard-issue crepe pancake combined with a sweet, cottage cheese-like filling (or a savory potato and onion filling) that is then rolled into a small burrito-like form to fit nicely in the palm of your hand. Delicious!\n \nCome groove with the camp and ask your skilled blintz chefs for the latest flavor, and hang around in our shade structures to meet other hungry travelers. Blintzes will be offered every day from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, or until we’re out of blintzes",

Josie Posie leads a ceremony where the women of the playa welcome the men lovingly at the entrance to the dome, inviting them to match the high vibration they hold. The dome becomes an Ancient temple space. The men then stand in a circle offering unconditional love and healing to the community of women who gather in the center. The women come for healing their trust of the Masculine and to receive their love. This is a hands-off workshop. There is no touching except optional hugging at the end. When men show up and become the pure presence of their Divine Masculine nature and truly witness, then women can relax into their loving Divine Feminine nature and fully become that love. As both polarities open to their Divine essence, we transmute cultural wounds in the collective feminine and masculine for all of humanity, co-creating a needed and beautiful new story of balance.",

A guided meditation will help us bring balanced, clear awareness to our breath, body sensations, and thoughts in our minds, with some time afterwards for question and answer, and discussion.  Bring a something to sit on, if able.",

This is a safe, fun way to meet new people who are also participating in Open Relating and to gain some practical tools for your relationship or future relationship(s)!\n\nTo chose to live and relate in an open or polyamorous way requires a community of like-minded souls. Without community we do not have the necessary support we need as couples and individuals to love as big as our hearts desire.\n\nWhy we each consciously choose to live in alternative ways then the ones that were passed down to us from earlier generations is very personal. Some do it to increase the variety of sexual partners and others do it as a spiritual path to embrace the light and shadow of opening up.\n\nThere are many ways to make it work. Some people have stated agreements meanwhile others rely on embodied principles and some are just totally radical. Regardless of your personal preference, most of us were not raised with role models for this alternative way of relating. So we must come together to role model and mirror one another.\n\nAs the definition and practice of relating is expanding beyond what we were taught unconsciously by our parents we want to invite you to join the conversation. How do you navigate these waters? What have you found that works? Come just to listen and observe or come to participate and add your own thoughts, questions and perspectives into the conversation.\n\nWe invite you to share what is most alive in your heart and come join the conversation of open relationships where we aim to come together to create a Culture of Conscious Relating.\"",

    "description": "Rituals Arts Collective's 'Sailing the Dead Seas: Rockin' the Boats!' installation is anchored in our childhood; you'll see a flotilla of oversized, whimsical, origami-like colorful 'paper boats,' each floating upon its 'waves.' Each boat is actually a teeter totter, ready to be rocked by the participants. As every craft has environmental sensors installed within, you'll hear incredible, albeit low-key musical tones, as 'played' by the wind, and motion of the boats. The effect is bio-elemental, aural soothing of our minds. Participants will find the interior of the (easily accessible) boats gilded in silver and gold, filled with inspirational quotes to complete the experience. Each ship/shrine has materials to write 'notes of hope' and means of containing these utterances by attendees (Truth be told, these boats act as walk-aboard shrine(s) to inspire Burning Man attendees to leave notes for us to burn off-playa in a ceremony, so their wishes may be granted to the winds after the Burning Man event. ;) The reason for 'Dead Seas' in the title is twofold: the playa's dry lake bed, and the actual Dead Sea in Jordan-- both have high mineral content, that which nourishes souls who 'float' in it. \n\nThat’s NOT all! ;o)\n\nThere be CHRISTENINGS, Ye Mateys! Help us christen our boats at the Playa Art Park and on the Playa itself!\n\nMonday, 1:00 pm: \n\nOur lead ship will be christened, and bubbly cider and water will be served to all #Land Pirates that attend! (But of course, bring yer cups and while supplies last! ;)\n\nTuesday, 1:00 pm: \n\nOur first flotilla of ships on the playa will be christened, and bubbly cider and water will be served to all #Land Pirates that attend!

Learn who shows up to our rescue when we are triggered (into primal instincts such as Fight, Flight, Freeze, Submit, and Cry for help). We drop below the thinking mind into the wisdom of the body. To a depth from where it is easy and simple to relate most intimately. Here we drop the guard and lead with the last thing we want our partner to know about us.

AT has been shown to be an effective tool in preventative medicine, stress-related disorders and panic attacks. It can relieve tension, lessen anxiety, and enhance performance. As the world's first western developed mediation technique, AT is a neurological and psycho-physiological tool or therapy for psychological and medical self-healing. \n\nAT takes you through a series of validated and prescriptive mental exercises that target specific physiological reactions in the brain and body that underpin optimal health and well-being. Through the power of self-suggestion you are taught how to consciously and intentionally control your Autonomic Nervous System. AT is for anyone who wants to benefit from gaining the self-help tools to manage stress in the present and to develop long term strategies to reduce stress and anxiety. It is also of benefit for qualified or trainee psychotherapists who wish to gain a deeper trust in their relationship with 'self' and for those in the caring professions who want to learn new techniques for self-care. The technique was developed by the German psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz and first published in 1932. \n\nEach session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures (for example, lying down, sitting meditation, sitting like a rag doll).On a micro level of regeneration, Autogenics retrains cells, glands, the brain and organs to behave as they are ‘meant to’, that is, to work in harmony and to restore the natural order. We are now coming to understand AT’s role in neuro-plasticity, gut health, epigenetic modulation and the placebo response. The future for AT world-wide in becoming a mainstream therapy for the self-regulation of body-mind healing and optimal functioning is exciting!",

Set in a post Refoamation environment, our theme from last year which asked people to confess their environmental sins to animals and experience life behind bars, this year’s Transfoamation involves a multi-stage process developed in conjunction with LGTBQ community which will highlight person-to-personal exercises diving into identity as participants queue up. After completing all prefoamation rituals to join our Tranfoamation they will shed their old dusty selves and clothing, enter our transfoam chamber, and ascend to the final stage of their actual Transfoamation to oneness with the universe and their fellow human in the transblastive foam experience. \n\nTransfoamation will take place daily starting on Wednesday and ending on Saturday at 12:00 -1:00pm for children under 13, 1:00 - 4:20pm for all people of all ages. We are usually located near 2:15/G. \n\nTransfoamation is also the home base of an amazing community that services the city 24 hours a day in a number of ways.  Besides the wonder of a daily personal Transfoamation we offer, the camp serves as the home base of the volunteer professionals working with the Zendo project that provides psychological harm reduction services across the BRC.  We host trainings for Zendo staff in our camp and run a 400 plate per meal kitchen connected to the Transfoamation and Zendo.  We will have a midday hydration area at the exit of our Transfoam Dome run by our camp as well. Also part of the Transfoam camp is the Abraxas Mutant vehicle team.\n\nOur camp changes it's name every year. Previous years we have been called Refoamation, Something Freaky This Way Foams, Fauxmirage, UFOm, Faux Mitzvah, Foamo Aragato, and Foam Saves.",

Harry Potter nerds welcome! \n\nWhy Patronus and not sspirit animal? Spirit animal is a culturally appropriated term which bastardized an important and significant Native American spiritual practice into white girls calling Lindsay Lohan their spirit animal as she crashes her car drunk with Coke all over her nose. Patronus is the non-offensive Harry Potter originated word that is the animal that forms at the end of your wand to protect against dementors. #themoreyouknow \n\nNot sure what your Patronus is? Here's an easy quiz to find out: https://tinyurl.com/lx2k7rz\n\nFor the past nine years, a Seattle-based group of friends have been traveling to Burning Man, spreading the love of Burning Man upon return, and growing larger with each burn. In 2016, Champagne Campaign was first officially placed as a registered theme camp. The universal activity enjoyed by this group of friends is meeting at 12:00 in front of the temple every sunrise for a champagne toast to the new day. This group of friends has continued the sunrise tradition at home in Seattle, and plans sunrise champagne events during the summer. At Burning Man, Champagne Campaign is an interactive camp that hosts daily debates in a campaign-esque setting. Our champagne bar is open during debate hours to encourage lively debates paired with champagne party punch. We encourage lively debates where people are free to give their opinion no matter the absurdity and engage themselves among burners of all different backgrounds and opinions. Champagne Campaign returns to Burning Man in 2017 in that hopes that it will continue to be an interactive inclusive theme camp for years to come on playa as well as in Seattle. All proceeds go to getting our camp to the playa and stocking our bar so we can gift the joy of champagne all week long!",

Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through group laughter. It’s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits.

Swat a sperm-shaped tether ball, pass through a leaky condom, jump over a big freakin’ bible, through a coat hanger, climb a set of stairs to nowhere, chill in the womb. \nCulminates in a slide through a giant vagina where you are re-birthed near the bar and greeted with heckling encouragement and a possible spank on the bottom from a genuine playa doctor. During clinic events, our camp members will guide canal visitors: If you need lube or a slap on the ass we are there for you. But the experience stands alone at any time of day or night.

This will be the main event of the day :-)\n- 12:30 Florida Gators vs Michigan Wolverines...wear your colors & Go Blue!\n\nThe big late game will be:\n- 5:00 Florida State Seminoles vs Alabama Crimson Tide\nThis game will end around 8:30 - 8:45...the Man Burn takes place at 9:30, so come prepared and be ready to bolt at the end of the game.\n\nBonus coverage:\n- 6:30 BYU Cougars vs LSU Tigers\nThis game will end while the Man Burn is underway...responsible fans may watch and shut down the Cafe.\n\nIf you have a request for a particular early or late starting college game, the management of the Harmonic Cafe will try to accommodate. With all the Michigan fans, it's likely we won't be showing other games during the midday slot. More game times will be announced...please let us know what games you're interested in :-)",

    "description": "\"BOTH genders are welcome in this gender fluid workshop!\n\n(The terms female/women or male/men are used loosely indicating people who self identify as male or female.)\n\nIn this last year and a half I have been delving into sexuality and examining societal beliefs around intimacy. It has become clear to me that sexuality is a fast track to discovering the blind spots which hinder us from intimacy. One of the most fruitful areas of exploration for myself has been in the area of male to male intimacy and gender fluidity. Through my experiences i have found that most men are guarded in ways that protect them from experiencing doubt around their own male sovereignty. For example most of us have been taught that to be affectionate with other males is wrong and means that we are \"\"homosexual\"\" or weak. \n\nA recent study by Harvard shows that humans are actually gender fluid and most of our gender identity is indoctrinated into us through our family systems, society, and the media. \n\nThe fruit which comes from exploring male to male intimacy on an energetic and physical level is that all of our male armor/guarded defense systems vanish and we develop a greater level or capacity for intimacy with all people including women. \n\nThe structure of the workshop allows men to explore their relationships with their fathers, brothers and friends and then moves gently towards male to male affection, culminating in energetic play with sexual energy. This is not a clothing optional work shop, personal boundaries will be respected all of the time, and personal safety a priority! Participants will always be at choice and have a multitude of different opportunities with which to explore this theme. Women will hold space and at times participate in this exploration and benefit from observing what occurs in the room. \n\nGratitude and blessings\n\nTimothy\"",

As a first generation East Indian woman, physician, and mystic, I have battled through my own psyche to find clarity that I revere as a guide for my being in this world.  The spiritual crisis has been a fundamental struggle, as my life has been a search for identity in a new culture that clashes fiercely with that of my native heritage.  While India is vibrant with with fragrance, texture, sound, and color, a constant sensory exploration,  America has been overworked and desensitized by violence, oppression, ignorance, and suffering.  Initially a victim of this plight, Great Spirit ultimately granted the gifts of True Wisdom.  However, integration from the expansive awakening of unity consciousness to the mundane experience of ordinary life is no small task.  From the strength of humanity and the love of true friendships to miracles and the cosmic vibration found in the echoes of stillness, this is a story of that wonderful journey.",

Okay not really, but we pretend murder them at murder mystery parties.  So we thought, why not bring this kind of fun home with us?\n\nWe will host at three scheduled murders through-out the week, each being about an hour and a half event. Everyone gets a character to play and clues to help solve the murder. There is an emcee that keeps things moving along but this is performance art in its rawest form, everyone is a suspect (or the recently deceased) and it is up to the group to collaborate, negotiate shady agreements, blackmail or otherwise enjoy themselves.\n\nEach murder requires twenty people to play the roles for each murder we commit.  Each murder has a theme; a Circus, Santa's Workshop and an 80's Homecoming murder.  We encourage participants to come in costume and/or fully embrace their character.  We're snarky too so if people need a clue right there on the spot, a clue will be written for them and handed over in a small envelope.  A sample clue would be: \"Shave your goatee, with a knife, to get more pussy, in the lounge, you fucking hippie.\"  It's a silly good time and everyone gets drunk or hydrated, meets new people and whether they crack the case or not they win shit for best actor, best briber, best sleuth, best dressed.\n\nOn the days we're not committing foul play we will host a bar and a water hydration station (a giant igloo dispenser available throughout the entire day, filled with Earth20 from Bend, Oregon and chilled with a block of ice).",

The purpose of this workshop is to educate and enlighten those interested in knowing more about this 3% of the public that few understand. This workshop seeks to help transphobic people in a non-judgmental way. The very basic definition transphobia, is simply being frightened of trans-folks because of misunderstandings or lack of education on all things trans. This is often because the questions you’ve always wanted to ask, are taboo; making it difficult to learn, understand, and honor the transgender path. Open to all. \n\nTrans 101: The Nuts and Bolts.\nA brief PowerPoint discussion of definitions and the basics of gender, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. How are transgender and cisgender people alike? How are they different?\n\nTrans 201: A Peak Through the Veil.\nAfter learning the basics, we’ll have a Q&A session where any and all questions will be fielded. We all know that there are questions that are deemed inappropriate to ask a transperson. For this brief moment in time, there are no taboos. We will do our best to answer your questions with honesty, transparency, and sincerity.\"",

All skill levels welcome, subject of the design TBD based on consensus and or skill level of the class :) We plan to then bake the beads after the class. They can be worn on necklaces or crafted into buttons so feel free to bring your own necklace material, twine, or pins to attach to the polymer clay. Plan to spend about 45min to an hour creating your beautiful beads and approximately an additional 20 minutes for bake time in our ovens! All ages and skill levels welcome. Clay will be provided but feel free to bring your own if you brought some by chance to the playa.

Born literally from a dream after returning from Burning Man about ten years ago, my vision embraced the core of the human body - the Anterior Superior Iliac Spine and the visible line of the Inguinal Ligament. A dream of dancers, hoopers, fire spinners and burners moving in every manner of human endeavor on the Playa and always the ASIS supporting the human form with such graceful, sensual strength. The Playa ASIS Project will attempt to capture the absolutely unique core of the individual in context of the Burning Man experience. This is not genital photography and we will limit identifying markers to your ASIS. Final artistic discretion will remain with the photographer.\nThis ASIS project will have a stationary location in our camp's community monkeyhut space on Tues. and Thurs. from 12pm to 2pm, but will also be roaming the playa with a photo wagon Mon., Wed. and Fri. Photos taken will be used for a anonymous encyclopedia of playa ASIS. Subjects will only be photographed if they choose to be part of the project. No records are kept on participants making the photos essentially anonymous.",

We have found even seasoned burners can be surprised by the fragility of their bodies in our dusty wonderland. By offering various OTC remedies we hope to mitigate trivial demands on Rampart medical services and provide a gentle lesson in self-sufficiency along with the bandaid and a hug.

Eager participants in need of a little freshening up can score a dainty thong, beefy briefs or a naughty hybrid that tap dances on the line between decency and profane.

The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality. You don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to get there. The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. How? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory \"hooks\" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel \"good.” We will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process. After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group. We look forward to sharing your future day together. Dr. Feelgood.\n\n\nThe 45 Minute Meditation Session is 2PM M-F and followed up with creative cocktails, step up and have a feel good drink at our Camp Feel Good Compliment Bar/Sherpa Foot washing station!\n\nFor those in need of a deep dive in what you want out of life, we offer an Advice Booth Open every day!",

It is difficult to identify the genre of this theatre's stagings (as the word \"genre\" in itself implies some kind of traditionalism) and perhaps the company's style is closest to modern choreography in its most nonconformist form. The shows tell no story, reveal no plot, have no dimensions, or narrative. Rather, they mirror reality through dreams, bordering on that thin line between the outer and the inner worlds that interacts with the spectator through their own intuition or unconsciousness. As in the 'absolute mirror', every single person should see in each their work, an inner world and their own particular destiny. \nblackSKYwhite has received important awards for innovation in theater at FringeFirst - the international performing arts festival in Edinburgh, Scotland and have headlined performances at Glastronbury Festival.

He will then show us the intriguing inter-workings of the human endocannabinoid system, our body's system of natural \"cannabis-like\" molecules.  He will fascinate us with the latest research and science on the health effects of this unique plant.

And evidence is stacking up that psychoactive plants have played a major role in the development of language, art, and culture – not just for human beings, but across the biosphere.  \n\nAnd as within, so without: the dragons on the edge of our maps are turning into Pokémon in AR gaming; our science fiction narratives of de-extincted dinosaurs are looking likelier each day with radical advances in genetic engineering.  \n\nThanks to the psychedelic (\"mind manifesting\") power of our Promethean technologies, our dreams and fears have never been so fast to manifest as they are now.  It is time for us to take a long, hard look at what might be, if ANYTHING is possible. \n\nWhat did the psychedelic revolution of the 1960s teach us about how to handle the immense and terrifying pace of change these days?  Tim Leary said PCs would be the next LSD – and, in fact, it was their visionary journeys that they thank for inspiration, almost all the masterminds of the computing revolution.

She has a BA in Ecology from New College of Florida, a school that explicitly values ecstatic wonder. She was in a PhD program for Integrative Conservation, but left after realizing that humanity’s socioecological crises won't be solved by data alone: we need better tools for looking at hard problems with self-compassion, and for communicating and coordinating to co-create solutions. She writes about these topics, as well as psychedelic integration, at pricklesandgoo.com. \n\n \nThese places where reason and spirituality come into conflict can provide fertile ground for cultivating new ways of understanding and relating. If we can turn towards the tensions that arise when our existing belief structures are not able to meet our needs, we can find opportunities to help those frameworks grow and expand. I want to make spaces where we can allow our sense of the sacred to encompass the deep and beautiful metaphors that science has discovered, and where we can allow our need for analytical understanding to take in the complexity and uncertainty of the world in all its rich variety.",

Specific musical instruments played during the meditation allow participants to use sound as a therapeutic tool to disconnect from discursive thinking and delve into a transcendental state. The goal is to enable participants to disengage their undesirable habitual patterns and to empower positive cognitive change. Most of the instruments used in a Sound Meditation are overtone-emitting instruments such as gongs, Tibetan singing bowls, bells, metallic discs, etc. These instruments have been used in meditation and sound healing for centuries in many cultures and continue to be used.\nAlexandre has conducted ethnomusicology fieldwork for 18 years in over 40 countries. His research investigates issues of acculturation, community, musical identity in an urban setting, and the concepts of talent, charisma, and leadership in music.",

Learn the basics of spanking, paddling, flogging, and whipping. During the class, participants will study how to gently bind, blindfold, gag, and/or prepare their partner for a round of loving smacks, whips, and spanks. Engage in sensual play designed to express love through pain and power tactics. Understand the difference between doms and subs and discover your true nature in the realm of BDSM. Mistress Jade will personally guide each couple in how to manipulate, treat, and care for their bodies and how to avoid hurt and confusion during play. Materials will be provided, but feel free to bring your own love instruments to class. \n\nMistress Jade runs a tight ship. There is a strict hassle-free class rule: no threatening, close-minded, or rude participants will be allowed to stay. Check all your expectations and predispositions at the door. All students can expect a safe, supportive, and encouraging atmosphere. But beware, you WILL give and receive some loving pain, and you will always thank your hostess and your partners when doing so. Now don't be late! There will be a price to pay...that only your sweet bottom can afford!",

Trey Ratcliff here for the 8th photo walk - Sooo excited!\n\nDo you like taking photos or perhaps do you like people taking photos of you in all your fabuloso Burner gear? Well come on out and join this fun event - all are welcome! 🙂 It's great for beginner photographers all the way to advanced - bring anything from a mobile phone to a DSLR! We'll roam the streets of BRC and capture some of the magic of Burning Man together. \n\nI'll be giving lots of tips and tricks to help you on your own creative journey. We also talk a lot about the creative process and how it can be quite an active meditation bringing more consciousness, presence, and awesomeness into your life. So, come, bring a friend or three, and let's have a ball. Word has it that we'll get a bunch of Burner Girls too that just dance around and have thousands of photos taken of them. You know the type. Good times.\n\nAnd after, we'll share all the photos in the Facebook event at https://goo.gl/PGy7Qq . Check the comments in the event to make some new Instagram friends with fellow photo walkers too! 🙂\n\nWe'll meet outside of Center Camp TUESDAY at 6 PM and start the crawl from there!",

Come to the schoolroom at Mystikal Misfits to learn some simple techniques to help you stay cool and get your Burn back on track any time you feel disappointed, irritated or upset by the trials of the playa. The session will be hosted by Camp Combobulated and led by a long-time Burner who’s an IRL expert in showing people how to boost their resilience and wellbeing by using science-based strategies (based on solid research in psychology and neuroscience). She’ll give you practical tips to keep your dusty brain functioning at its best, and other Combobulated veterans will answer any questions you have about using these kinds of tactics to stay sane and happy in BRC.",

    "description": "Making drinking plans for your camp? Do those plans include lots and lots of aluminum cans? Want to unload all those empty cans on playa while also helping the kids of Gerlach? \n\nWell then come on down to Recycle Camp and SHOW US YOUR CANS! At Recycle Camp we will take all of your aluminum cans of your hands as part of our gift to the playa. We are located directly behind the Center Camp Café on 6:00 and are open every day 9am to 5pm. Please no drop offs: participate! When you get there, we will help you quickly separate your cans before riding THE CRUSHINATOR, our magical bicycle-powered can crushing apparatus that crushes your cans flat so we can store as many as possible before scrapping the aluminum off-site. All of the money we generate from aluminum recycling is donated directly to the Gerlach school system. Everybody wins!\n\nWe can only accept ALUMINUM cans. Please no glass, plastic, steel, or tin cans, so please keep all of your water bottles, tetrapaks, soup cans, and coconut waters separated. A good rule of thumb for figuring out if something is aluminum: if you can't crush it by hand, then we don't want it! Some stout beers like Guinness also have a plastic widget inside that cannot be recycled with the aluminum, please remove it beforehand or we can show you how. \n\nPROTIP from the Recyclenaut Aluminati: bring a MESH bag to collect all of your cans in. Plastic garbage bags don't allow your cans to dry out and create a foul, sticky sludge. If you store them in a mesh bag before bringing them over to Recycle Camp it helps make things a little less juicy for you when we they get sorted and crushed. Be smart, plan ahead, Recycle Camp wants YOU to come CRUSH it with us!!!",

If all you can do is stand there and re do your high school graduation photo then that is what you will get.\nHOWEVER, if you approach the photograph with an open mind and a willingness to try to help me make something interesting you will be rewarded with something unique.\nPlease come by, relax in our shade structure, look over prints from previous years, possibly get inspired and most importantly get your portrait done.",

This workshop is called “Clarity and Consent” because it is about clearly communicating desires and boundaries for consensual sexual activity.\n\nThe subtitle of this playshop is “Negotiating Sex on the Playa,” so some of the material is about how to get to a positive, consensual agreement. But a negotiation is also successful if it helps to avoid an unwanted outcome, so we also discuss how to convince someone to go away. B.E.D. values the right of individual choice, which includes the right to choose NOT to have sex.\n\nWe don’t care what gender you appear to be, or what gender you claim to be, or what kinds of partners you prefer. What matters is communication and consent. All are welcome to attend this \"Clarity and Consent Playshop\" presented by the Bureau of Erotic Discourse - at RhythmWave!",

    "description": "When our world is closer to the Otherworld, the spirits often traverse the thin spaces, and it is at dusk when the aes sidhe welcome the coming of the night. In a ritual that stretches back before the coming of humankind – and that also anticipates a future when humans no longer exist – the aes sidhe revel in the endless cycle of light and darkness. In a hint of what is to come, those who find themselves in the path of the sidhe court first smell and taste the dusty grit of death and rebirth. Then they hear a pounding beat that heralds the bursting of the court from the Otherworld. Bystanders soon see a dark figure with pulsing veins of red light, curling horns, and a silver face that reflects a person’s soul back at them, followed by cavorting figures who tap rhythms on a variety of drums. \n\nIn a twisted caricature of the Pied Piper leading children astray, some of the aes sidhe beat a march for the procession, while other figures dart amongst onlookers, drawing bystanders into the procession as the group strides toward ritual stations of drums and light. The court – and its newly found attendants – pound a rhythm as the sun sinks below the horizon towards the inevitable transition, and transformation, from light to dark. The dark sidhe and its new court howl in joy as the glowing orb disappears beyond the skyline, welcoming the blessed cool of night.\n \nThe aes sidhe are looking for you to join our procession. Every dusk we will travel from our home at the ¡Bang! Tower to esplanade as we greet the dark in an expression of drumming, primal howling, and whatever else you can think up. The Gloaming procession will draw Black Rock City’s citizens to our 32 stations of drum and light placed around Esplanade. Join us as a spirit of the dark in a drumming celebration of sundown. \n\nIf you want to join us, link up with our Facebook group [https://www.facebook.com/BANGtribe/], email us, or swing by the 30-foot tall ¡Bang! Tower at the Baconeers Camp at 4:15 and Dance.",

Non- ordinary states of consciousness can come with their own sets of 'superpowers', operating principles and potential pitfalls.

    "description": "Cultural appropriation is a topic that brings heated debate nearly every time it’s mentioned. Quite often, ignorant westerners who were raised to purchase meaning on a shelf or through a TV set can trigger sensitivities within traditional or sacred cultures, while at the same time individuals that seek in earnest to experience authentic meaning by transcending that very same commercial culture are easily stereotyped as insensitive or as frauds. The word “shamanism,” for example, is taken for granted and thrown around casually in festival culture, and yet who can agree on what it truly means in our context or who it legitimately offends?\n\nWe’ll uncover the complex history of this term while exploring a vision for planetary culture that integrates the profane and materialistic west with the sacred magic of the indigenous and the archaic. The story of the west is surprisingly rich with culture heroes (including the Cacophony Society and Suicide Club groups that Burning Man emerged from) that point the way towards a rich and meaningful cultural future, despite the overwhelming totality of capitalism. In fact, in the development of a global psychedelic culture, the world market has actually paved the way for a diverse confluence of neo-tribal adaptation and integration much the same way as the Romans built the roads that ultimately spread Christianity. Authentic cultural appropriation is the way forward and superficial cultural appropriation is a natural evolutionary byproduct.",

    "name": "Midnight Ridazz: Friday Night Ride",
    "description": "When someone says \"Midnight Ridazz!!\" \nYou say \"RIDE ON!!\"\n\nThe Midnight Ridazz is formally described as a group of bicycle enthusiasts who have been riding together on the second Friday of every month since February of 2004. Originally conceived and founded by SKULL and lovingly cared for by MABELL, MUFF and a small group of planners and care takers, the rides quickly grew from the original 8 \"Mammas and Papas\" to current ride counts of 1300+ Ridazz.\n\nSkeptics may scoff at the irreverence of this alleged \"Party on Wheels.\" But the party atmosphere just might be what has made this simple bicycle ride so popular in a city like Los Angeles where people barely get their mail without hopping in a car. Some attribute the movement to the high assed gas prices, or the frustration of LA traffic. Still others simply write off the Midnight Ridazz as a bunch of bored art school students. It's all of these things and more! \n\nConsider: Riding a bicycle is a sensual alternative to the \"boy in the bubble\" car voyages that hide everything good that a city has to offer. It is an experience in sights, sounds, thrills, physical activity, and local economy that could never be replicated by a night out at (Sh)City Walk. Midnight Ridazz is about riding bicyles, hanging out, acting silly, being whimsical, speaking up, and having a good heart. Come out and enjoy a relaxed pace bicycle ride at the end of a week of computers, dispatchers, rude customers, corporate politics and all the other crap that comes with living in a world of sad clowns. Banish the clowns! Send in the Ridazz.\n\n\nJOIN US.\nMoving forward we're inviting everybody to join in the fun. The Ridazz that be have created this site to help empower YOU to create your own rides, routes and good timezz. Start yourself a recurring ride, have a bar crawl or even throw a one timer in the daylight... It's your ride.",

The next two hours involve a meditative sound practice, using sound, breath, and voice, combined with our imagination and intention, to create a warm and nurturing sonic space that enables us to quiet our minds and venture within. From there, we can explore deeper states of consciousness.\n\nThe sounds of gongs, singing bowls, chimes, drums, and other instruments are not just heard through our ears, but are also felt by our bodies: our skin, bones, cells, and the fluids within us resonate with the sound’s vibrations. Sound can also trigger memories and emotions. Therefore, with focused listening and presence—by meditating on sound—we can work through underlying stress, release blocks, and bring ourselves into states of relaxation and well-being.",

To alter its unsustainable trajectory, women, grateful for men’s guidance, thus far, NOW must take over!  \n\nI am spearheading the feminine power revolution, changing the paradigm.  With 45 yearsʻ experience as a political activist in the progressive, womenʻs rights, environmental and health arenas; 40 yearsʻ studying and teaching meditation and martial arts; and successful careers in performing and travel (world-wide), fashion (Paris), food (Hong Kong), and education (New York and Maui), I am seeding the awareness required to extract our society from servitude (to banks, corporations and demagogues) and to redirect it toward service, and a radiant horizon of planetary well-being and conscious decision-making.\n\nOur testosterone-driven “leadership by domination” has resulted in: irreversible climate change, international policies of conquest, unprecedented concentration of wealth (a caste society), corporate contamination of our food supply and idolization of conspicuous consumption.  We are on the verge of the next planetary extinction event.  Meanwhile, the 99%, glued to government-manipulated media, wallows in wanton complacency.  \n\nNow, women are rising up and re-taking the reins. Because of our biochemical makeup, we are scientifically proven to be more compassionate and less aggressive (the vast majority of all past and current peaceful societies are “matriarchal”).  \nI propose an end to complacency, and offer a passionate call to action.

We are asking Burners to radically participate on the Playa in 2017 by reading a single page from Chapter 6 of Joyce's masterpiece on camera.\n\nThis will be our second year filming a chapter of Wake at Burning Man. In 2016, we filmed 121 Burners perform chapter 7 (Shem the Penman) of Wake. Here are a few short clips from last year's episode:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/50hbiUY87W0\n\nPlease choose the page you'd like to perform this year from chapter 6 of FW at this link:\n\nhttp://www.finwake.com/1024chapter6/1024finn6.htm\n\nYou can also bring along your favorite piece of music on your phone to accompany your reading if you like, and we will run the audio for your performance thru our mixer.\n\nThe final goal of our Finnegan Wakes project is to provide the world with the first ever complete edition of Finnegans Wake on film, performed by Burners from around the world.\n\nWe'll be posting updates at the FB group in this posting regarding when and where we'll be filming performances around BRC so please join the FB group for updates. This year, Finnegans Wake on the Playa will be based in the Dream-Land of Camp Fuego at 6:15 and H.\n\nThe complete episode (chapter 7) from 2016 can be viewed here:\nhttps://youtu.be/yReE0yoVTSE",

    "description": "Through the gates of dawn to the endless river, take a journey through time and space as we immerse ourselves in a flow of instrumental excerpts from over 40 years of the Pink Floyd discography.  Be inspired to dance and meditate, release your inner animal and break through your walls. From the dark side of the moon to the heart of the sun, the tiniest atom to the great interstellar expanse, the pulse of life to the great beyond, let us leave behind our divisions.  The eclipse brings darkness, yet the light ever returns.  We will always shine on, my bright ambassadors!  When the time comes, my only thought will be, I wish you were here.  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \nA note from the arranger:  This has been a project long in the making.  I have often felt the call of the dance from Pink Floyd’s music, momentary spans from so many different songs that called out to be joined together in one great epic track.  What you will hear has been carefully selected, shaped and spliced together to create a seamless experience, from a meditative beginning, ever amplified with a gentle rise in intensity, until we reach a riotous celebration of life and energy at the peak.   Like life itself, we release completely, winding down to a great finality.  What is at the end of our journey?  Have we lived our lives as completely and fully as we ever desired, as we look back from that long road?  We can only answer these questions for ourselves.  I invite you to take this opportunity to reflect on these things, and be yourself, as completely and fully as possible.   Let us live in a world we call can share.  With Love, Blue Jay",

Harm Reduction is also a movement for social justice built on a belief in the fundamental civil rights of people who use drugs. Mitchell Gomez will host this 'introduction to harm reduction' talk, with an open Q&A at the end. Today, electronic music is the fastest growing youth culture, and the community DanceSafe serves stretches far and wide. Current programs and initiatives aim to provide safe spaces to engage in conversations about health, drug use, and personal safety; provide free water, electrolytes, safe sex tools, and ear plugs at EDM events; provide honest, fact-based, unbiased information on drug effects and potential harms; offer nonjudgmental first-point of contact to risky or challenging situations; offer drug checking services to prevent overdoses and death; and work with promoters and local stakeholders to advocate for safety first approaches. Come hear Mitchell from DanceSafe talk about harm reduction in general, and it's application to Burn Culture (as well as unique challenges of the Playa).",
